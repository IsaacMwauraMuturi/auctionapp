# Online Auctions System

## Description

The Online Auction System will be designed to facilitate the auctioning of items in an online marketplace, where users can bid on items in real-time. The system allows users to register as buyers or sellers, place bids on auctioned items, and track the auction progress. Sellers can list items for auction with a minimum bid price and a set auction duration. The highest bidder at the end of the auction wins the item, and the system manages the communication between buyers and sellers, ensuring smooth transactions. The project shall leverage best practise as illustrated in *Steve McConellâ€™s Code Complete*

## Objective

The system should:
- Allow sellers to create and manage auctions for items.
- Enable buyers to place bids and monitor auction progress.
- Notify users of bidding status changes.
- Automatically determine the winner when the auction ends
